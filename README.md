This repository implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify plant leaf diseases using TensorFlow Keras. 
The model is trained on the Plant Village dataset, a large collection of labeled images of healthy and diseased plant leaves.

Features

Utilizes TensorFlow Keras for building and training the CNN model.
Leverages the Plant Village dataset from Kaggle, offering a diverse range of plant species and diseases.
Achieves accuracy of 90.4% in classifying plant leaf diseases.
